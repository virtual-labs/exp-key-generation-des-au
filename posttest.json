      "question": "How many subkeys are generated in the DES key generation process?",

        "c": "16",
        "d": "32"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. There are more than 8 subkeys generated in DES.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There are more than 10 subkeys generated in DES.",
        "c": "Correct. DES generates 16 subkeys for use in each of the 16 rounds of encryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There are not as many as 32 subkeys in DES; there are only 16."

      "question": "Which component of the DES key generation is responsible for selecting 48 out of 56 bits to create a subkey?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Initial permutation (IP)",
        "b": "Expansion permutation (E)",
        "c": "Compression permutation (PC-2)",
        "d": "Straight permutation (P)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial permutation is involved in the encryption process, not key generation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The expansion permutation is used in the encryption function to expand the data block.",
        "c": "Correct. The PC-2 compression permutation selects 48 out of 56 bits during subkey generation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The straight permutation is part of the encryption function, not the key generation."

      "question": "DES produces 16 round keys. If you mistakenly do two left shifts in round 2 (instead of 1), how many round keys will become wrong?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Only round 2",
        "b": "Only rounds 2–4",

      "question": "In the DES algorithm, although the key size is 64 bits, only 48bits are used for the encryption procedure, the rest are parity bits.",
