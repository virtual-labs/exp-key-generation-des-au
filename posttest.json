        "c": "16",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. There are more than 8 subkeys generated in DES.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There are more than 10 subkeys generated in DES.",
        "c": "Correct. DES generates 16 subkeys for use in each of the 16 rounds of encryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There are not as many as 32 subkeys in DES; there are only 16."

      "question": "Which component of the DES key generation is responsible for selecting 48 out of 56 bits to create a subkey?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Initial permutation (IP)",
        "b": "Expansion permutation (E)",
        "c": "Compression permutation (PC-2)",
        "d": "Straight permutation (P)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial permutation is involved in the encryption process, not key generation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The expansion permutation is used in the encryption function to expand the data block.",
        "c": "Correct. The PC-2 compression permutation selects 48 out of 56 bits during subkey generation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The straight permutation is part of the encryption function, not the key generation."
