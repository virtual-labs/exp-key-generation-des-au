      "question": "What is the length of the initial key used in DES before subkey generation?",

        "a": "56 bits",
        "b": "64 bits",
        "c": "48 bits",
        "d": "32 bits"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect. The initial key length is 64 bits, although 8 bits are used for parity, leaving 56 bits for the actual key.",
        "b": "Correct. The initial key length for DES is 64 bits, with 8 of those bits used for parity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 48 bits is the length of each of the 16 round subkeys, not the initial key.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The initial key length is 64 bits, not 32 bits."

      "question": "In DES key generation, what is the purpose of the permutation boxes (P-boxes)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To expand the key size",
        "b": "To compress the key size",
        "c": "To permute the key bits",
        "d": "To encrypt the data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. P-boxes do not expand the key size; they permute the key bits.",
        "b": "Incorrect. P-boxes do not compress the key size; they permute the key bits.",
        "c": "Correct. P-boxes are used to permute the key bits during the subkey generation process.",
        "d": "Incorrect. P-boxes are not used to encrypt the data; they are used in the process of key generation."
